Hey, okay!
Ya life is going swell until the day that you find
There’s a black box that’s hidden inside of your mind
Passing the limit line,
You’re in it for a ride
It’s about time you step out
And start living your life
Life is a bitch, yeah, we all know that
It ain’t perfect but I’ll give it a chance
READY - STOP!
Ya know, it’s only the way of the world
So just do you best,
Forget the rest, yeah
HERE WE GO
All this time, I thought if I -
I didn’t feel the pain, I’d be fine
So I suppressed my heart and mind,
Letting all my passion die
I guess I’m not that different after all,
From the people I’ve always despised
And I hate myself that it’s come to this,
That I’m holding myself back without even really knowing why
No matter what I do, I know my dream
It has not a single chance of coming true
But no one can ever hope to smother out this flame in my heart
Even if the rain keeps pouring down forever,
Every day and night,
And soaks me to my very core
I will still keep this fire burning,
Deep inside of my soul, my pride, burns bright
It started pouring down, just like I believed it would
But then to my surprise, many friends were gathered at my side
While we talked of hopes and dreams
All our fun was pure and good,
But we got riled up, and we started a fist fight
We haven’t changed a bit, I will admit
From our early childhood days
Cause back then we still fought all the same
When we wanted to run away (ohh!)
I still remember when you laughed and said,
“Time hasn’t changed you at all”
I couldn’t help but laugh too,
Til I couldn’t even hear the rainfall
We gotta stand our ground,
Live with no fear,
Or even the thought alone will bring us down
I’m scared when I think about
The seconds I have let go to waste…
But now I see,
In a moment when the sky is clear,
I’m really my own enemy
But I know I can’t give up just yet
Deep inside of my soul, my pride, burns bright
READY - STOP
Look, it’s only the way of the world
So just do you best,
Forget the rest, yeah
HERE WE GO!
READY - STOP
Look, it’s only the way of the world
So just do you best,
Forget the rest, yeah
HERE WE GO!
No matter what I do,
Whenever I’m alone at night,
I start to lose myself a little more to the fight
But I know, if you were by my side,
Then I could change that fate –
And make it through this final storm
And whatever else might be in store
No matter how things turn out,
If I look lame - That’s something I’m no longer worried about
As long as I manage to rewrite my fate, I don’t give a damn
They say that destiny is set in stone,
But I don’t care if that’s what I’ve been told
I will prove that I can change it
And until then, I won’t quit
Cause deep inside, my core pride
I know it’s always burning bright
I can’t just let it go out yet
This fire in my heart
Under my breath,
I can’t forget
The feeling, burning hot
I can’t just let it go out yet
This fire in my heart
Through tears and sweat,
Till my last breath,
I’ll be the light
My pride burns bright!
